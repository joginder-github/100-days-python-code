# Question:
# Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Solution:
values = []
for i in range(1000, 2046):
    s = str(i)
    if (int(s[0])%2==0) and (int(s[1])%2==0) and (int(s[2])%2==0) and (int(s[3])%2==0):
        values.append(s)
print(",".join(values))


# output:

# 2000,2002,2004,2006,2008,2020,2022,2024,2026,2028,2040,2042,2044
