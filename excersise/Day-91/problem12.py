# Question:
# Write a program that computes the value of a+aa+aaa+aaaa with a given digit as the value of a.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 9
# Then, the output should be:
# 11106

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Solution:
a = input("Enter Any Number:")
n1 = int( "%s" % a )
n2 = int( "%s%s" % (a,a) )
n3 = int( "%s%s%s" % (a,a,a) )
n4 = int( "%s%s%s%s" % (a,a,a,a) )
print(n1+n2+n3+n4)


# output:

# Enter Any Number:6
# 7404
